# CEM-ES-with-Multithreading
Adaptation of my previous Cross Entropy Method implementation for the pole balancing problem to use multithreading. This one also saves its weights to a file. You can see the agent play the game with these weights by running cem_observe.py. I included weights obtained from a recent execution of cem.py. This was written during the may of 2018.
